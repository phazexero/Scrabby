 <p>
  A CUDA application binary (with one or more GPU kernels) can contain the compiled GPU code in two forms, binary cubin objects and forward-compatible PTX assembly for each kernel. Both cubin and PTX are generated for a certain target compute capability. A cubin generated for a certain compute capability is supported to run on any GPU with the same major revision and same or higher minor revision of compute capability. For example, a cubin generated for compute capability 8.0 is supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.6, however a cubin generated for compute capability 8.6 is
  not
  supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.0, and a cubin generated with compute capability 8.x is
  not
  supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 9.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kernel can also be compiled to a PTX form. At the application load time, PTX is compiled to cubin and the cubin is used for kernel execution. Unlike cubin, PTX is forward-compatible. Meaning PTX is supported to run on any GPU with compute capability higher than the compute capability assumed for generation of that PTX. For example, PTX code generated for compute capability 8.x is supported to run on compute capability 8.x or any higher revision (major or minor), including compute capability 9.0. Therefore although it is optional,
  it is recommended that all applications should include PTX of the kernels to ensure forward-compatibility.
  To read more about cubin and PTX compatibilities see
  <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compilation-with-nvcc">
   Compilation with NVCC
  </a>
  from the
  CUDA C++ Programming Guide
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  When a CUDA application launches a kernel on a GPU, the CUDA Runtime determines the compute capability of the GPU in the system and uses this information to find the best matching cubin or PTX version of the kernel. If a cubin compatible with that GPU is present in the binary, the cubin is used as-is for execution. Otherwise, the CUDA Runtime first generates compatible cubin by JIT-compiling
  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/hopper-compatibility-guide/index.html#fn1" id="id1">
   1
  </a>
  the PTX and then the cubin is used for the execution. If neither compatible cubin nor PTX is available, kernel launch results in a failure.
 </p>
 <p>
  Application binaries that include PTX version of kernels, should work as-is on the Hopper GPUs. In such cases, rebuilding the application is not required. However application binaries which do not include PTX (only include cubins), need to be rebuilt to run on the Hopper GPUs. To know more about building compatible applications read

  The first step towards making a CUDA application compatible with Hopper architecture is to check if the application binary already contains compatible GPU code (at least the PTX). The following sections explain how to accomplish this for an already built CUDA application.

 <p>
  CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit versions 2.1 through 11.7 are compatible with Hopper GPUs as long as they are built to include PTX versions of their kernels. This can be tested by forcing the PTX to JIT-compile at application load time with following the steps:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    Download and install the latest driver from
    <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/drivers">
     https://www.nvidia.com/drivers
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Set the environment variable
    <span class="pre">
     CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1
    </span>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Launch the application.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  With
  <span class="pre">
   CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1
  </span>
  , GPU binary code embedded in an application binary is ignored. Instead PTX code for each kernel is JIT-compiled to produce GPU binary code. An application fails to execute if it does not include PTX. This means the application is not Hopper architecture compatible and needs to be rebuilt for compatibility. On the other hand, if the application works properly with this environment variable set, then the application is Hopper compatible.
 </p>
 <p class="admonition-title">
  Note

 <p>
  Be sure to unset the
  <span class="pre">
   CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT

  environment variable after testing is done.

  CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit 11.8 are compatible with Hopper architecture as long as they are built to include kernels in native cubin (compute capability 9.0) or PTX form or both.

 <p>
  Depending on the version of the CUDA Toolkit used for building the application, it can be built to include PTX and/or native cubin for the Hopper architecture. Although it is enough to just include PTX, including native cubin also has the following advantages:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    It saves the end user the time it takes to JIT-compile kernels that are available only as PTX. All kernels which do not have native cubins are JIT-compiled from PTX, including kernels from all the libraries linked to the application, even if those kernels are never launched by the application
    <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/hopper-compatibility-guide/index.html#fn2" id="id2">
     2
    </a>
    . Especially when using large libraries, this JIT compilation can take a significant amount of time. The CUDA driver caches the cubins generated as a result of the PTX JIT, so this is mostly a one-time cost for a user, but it is time best avoided whenever possible.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    PTX JIT-compiled kernels often cannot take advantage of architectural features of newer GPUs, meaning that native-compiled cubins may be faster or of greater accuracy.

    PTX code compiled to target architecture conditional features using

  </span>
  will generate cubin files for all recent GPU architectures as well as a PTX version for forward compatibility with future GPU architectures, specify the appropriate
  <span class="pre">

  Alternatively, the simplified
  <span class="pre">
   nvcc
  </span>
  command-line option
  <span class="pre">
   -arch=sm_XX
  </span>
  can be used. It is a shorthand equivalent to the following more explicit
  <span class="pre">
   -gencode=
  </span>
  command-line options used above.
  <span class="pre">
   -arch=sm_XX
  </span>
  expands to the following:
 </p>
 <pre>-gencode=arch=compute_XX,code=sm_XX
-gencode=arch=compute_XX,code=compute_XX
</pre>
 <p>
  However, while the
  <span class="pre">
   -arch=sm_XX
  </span>
  command-line option does result in inclusion of a PTX back-end target binary by default, it can only specify a single target cubin architecture at a time, and it is not possible to use multiple
  <span class="pre">
   -arch=
  </span>
  options on the same
  <span class="pre">
   nvcc
  </span>
  command line, which is why the examples above use
  <span class="pre">
   -gencode=
  </span>
  explicitly.
 </p>
 <p>
  For CUDA toolkits prior to 11.0, one or more of the
  <span class="pre">
   -gencode
  </span>
  options need to be removed according to the architectures supported by the specific toolkit version (for example, CUDA toolkit 10.x supports architectures up to sm_72 and sm_75). The final
  <span class="pre">
   -gencode
  </span>
  to generate PTX also needs to be updated. For further information and examples see the documentation for the specific CUDA toolkit version.
