  This application note, Turing Compatibility Guide for CUDA Applications, is intended to help developers ensure that their NVIDIA
  Â®
  CUDA
  Â®
  applications will run on GPUs based on the NVIDIA
  Â®
  Turing Architecture. This document provides guidance to developers who are already familiar with programming in CUDA C++ and want to make sure that their software applications are compatible with Turing.

 <p>
  The NVIDIA CUDA C++ compiler,
  <span class="pre">
   nvcc
  </span>
  , can be used to generate both architecture-specific
  cubin
  files and forward-compatible
  PTX
  versions of each kernel. Each cubin file targets a specific compute-capability version and is forward-compatible
  only with GPU architectures of the same major version number
  . For example, cubin files that target compute capability 3.0 are supported on all compute-capability 3.x (Kepler) devices but are
  not
  supported on compute-capability 5.x (Maxwell) or 6.x (Pascal) devices. For this reason, to ensure forward compatibility with GPU architectures introduced after the application has been released, it is recommended that all applications include PTX versions of their kernels.
 </p>
 <p class="admonition-title">
  Note
 </p>
 <p>
  CUDA Runtime applications containing both cubin and PTX code for a given architecture will automatically use the cubin by default, keeping the PTX path strictly for forward-compatibility purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Applications that already include PTX versions of their kernels should work as-is on Turing-based GPUs. Applications that only support specific GPU architectures via cubin files, however, will need to be updated to provide Turing-compatible PTX or cubins.

  Compatibility between Volta and Turing

 <p>
  The Turing architecture is based on Voltaâs Instruction Set Architecture
  ISA
  7.0, extending it with new instructions. As a consequence, any binary that runs on Volta will be able to run on Turing (forward compatibility), but a Turing binary will not be able to run on Volta. Please note that Volta kernels using more than 64KB of shared memory (via the explicit opt-in, see
  CUDA C++ Programming Guide
  ) will not be able to launch on Turing, as they would exceed Turingâs shared memory capacity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most applications compiled for Volta should run efficiently on Turing, except if the application uses heavily the Tensor Cores, or if recompiling would allow use of new Turing-specific instructions. Voltaâs Tensor Core instructions can only reach half of the peak performance on Turing. Recompiling explicitly for Turing is thus recommended.

  The first step is to check that Turing-compatible device code (at least PTX) is compiled into the application. The following sections show how to accomplish this for applications built with different CUDA Toolkit versions.

 <p>
  CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit versions 2.1 through 8.0 are compatible with Turing as long as they are built to include PTX versions of their kernels. To test that PTX JIT is working for your application, you can do the following:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    Download and install the latest driver from
    <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nvidia.com/drivers">
     https://www.nvidia.com/drivers
    </a>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Set the environment variable
    <span class="pre">
     CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1
    </span>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Launch your application.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When starting a CUDA application for the first time with the above environment flag, the CUDA driver will JIT-compile the PTX for each CUDA kernel that is used into native cubin code.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you set the environment variable above and then launch your program and it works properly, then you have successfully verified Turing compatibility.
 </p>
 <p class="admonition-title">
  Note
 </p>
 <p>
  Be sure to unset the CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT environment variable when you are done testing.

 <p>
  When a CUDA application launches a kernel, the CUDA Runtime determines the compute capability of each GPU in the system and uses this information to automatically find the best matching cubin or PTX version of the kernel that is available. If a cubin file supporting the architecture of the target GPU is available, it is used; otherwise, the CUDA Runtime will load the PTX and JIT-compile that PTX to the GPUâs native cubin format before launching it. If neither is available, then the kernel launch will fail.
 </p>
 <p>
  The method used to build your application with either native cubin or at least PTX support for Turing depend on the version of the CUDA Toolkit used.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main advantages of providing native cubins are as follows:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    It saves the end user the time it takes to JIT-compile kernels that are available only as PTX. All kernels compiled into the application must have native binaries at load time or else they will be built just-in-time from PTX, including kernels from all libraries linked to the application, even if those kernels are never launched by the application. Especially when using large libraries, this JIT compilation can take a significant amount of time. The CUDA driver will cache the cubins generated as a result of the PTX JIT, so this is mostly a one-time cost for a given user, but it is time best avoided whenever possible.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    PTX JIT-compiled kernels often cannot take advantage of architectural features of newer GPUs, meaning that native-compiled code may be faster or of greater accuracy.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  The compilers included in CUDA Toolkit 8.0 or earlier generate cubin files native to earlier NVIDIA architectures such as Maxwell and Pascal, but they
  cannot
  generate cubin files native to Volta or Turing architecture. To allow support for Volta, Turing and future architectures when using version 8.0 or earlier of the CUDA Toolkit, the compiler must generate a PTX version of each kernel.

  The Volta and Turing architectures feature Independent Thread Scheduling among threads in a warp. If the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity,
  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/turing-compatibility-guide/index.html#fn1" id="id4">

  this feature can alter the set of threads participating in the executed code compared to previous architectures. Please see Compute Capability 7.0 in the
  CUDA C++ Programming Guide
  for details and corrective actions. To aid migration Volta and Turing developers can opt-in to the Pascal scheduling model with the following combination of compiler options.
