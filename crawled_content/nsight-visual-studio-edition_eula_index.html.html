   </p>
   <p>
    2.13 Â Â Â Â Â Â You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorneyâs fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to (i) products or services that have been developed or deployed with or use the Software, or claims that they violate laws, or infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right; or (ii) a violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

    You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the Software from your secure network to perform the work authorized by this Agreement on your behalf. If you are an academic institution, you may allow users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the Software as authorized by this Agreement from your secure network. You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or omission that if committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement if committed by your authorized users.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Pre-Release Versions.
    Software versions or specific features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA offerings. You may use pre-release Software at your own risk, understanding that such versions are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.

  <li>
   <p>
    Confidentiality.
    You agree that you will not use, nor authorize others to use, NVIDIA Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement, and that you will not disclose NVIDIA Confidential Information to any third party, except to permitted users under this Agreement that have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement, provided that each such recipient is subject to a written agreement that includes confidentiality obligations consistent with these terms. You will protect the NVIDIA Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that you use to protect your own similar confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. âConfidential Informationâ means the Software identified as âNDAâ or âProâ versions together with the output of such Software.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Components Under Other Licenses.
    The Software may include or be distributed with components provided with separate legal notices or terms that accompany the components, such as open source software licenses and other license. The components are subject to the applicable other licenses, including any proprietary notices, disclaimers, requirements and extended use rights; except that this Agreement will prevail regarding the use of third-party open source software, unless a third-party open source software license requires its license terms to prevail. Open source software license means any software, data or documentation subject to any license identified as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative (
    <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.org">
     http://opensource.org
    </a>
    ), Free Software Foundation (

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Termination.
    This Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from NVIDIA if you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Agreement or if you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the Software. Additionally, either party may terminate this Agreement at any time with prior written notice to the other party. You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information to verify your compliance with this Agreement. Upon any termination, you must stop using and destroy all copies of the Software and derivative works. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments under this section. All provisions will survive termination, except for the licenses granted to you.

    You may, but are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes, modifications, enhancements or other feedback regarding or in connection with your use of the Software (collectively, âFeedbackâ). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or its affiliates.
