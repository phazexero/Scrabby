 <p>
  The NVIDIAÂ® CUDAÂ® Toolkit enables developers to build NVIDIA GPU accelerated compute applications for desktop computers, enterprise, and data centers to hyperscalers. It consists of the CUDA compiler toolchain including the CUDA runtime (cudart) and various CUDA libraries and tools. To build an application, a developer has to install only the CUDA Toolkit and necessary libraries required for linking.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to run a CUDA application, the system should have a CUDA enabled GPU and an NVIDIA display driver that is compatible with the CUDA Toolkit that was used to build the application itself. If the application relies on dynamic linking for libraries, then the system should have the right version of such libraries as well.

  Every CUDA toolkit also ships with an NVIDIA display driver package for convenience. This driver supports all the features introduced in that version of the CUDA Toolkit. Please check the toolkit and driver version mapping in the release notes. The driver package includes both the user mode CUDA driver (libcuda.so) and kernel mode components necessary to run the application.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, upgrading a CUDA Toolkit involves upgrading both the toolkit and the driver to get the bleeding edge toolkit and driver capabilities.

  But this is not always required. CUDA Compatibility guarantees allow for upgrading only certain components and that will be the focus of the rest of this document. We will see how the upgrade to a new CUDA Toolkit can be simplified to not always require a full system upgrade.

  From CUDA 11 onwards, applications compiled with a CUDA Toolkit release from within a CUDA major release family can run, with limited feature-set, on systems having at least the minimum required driver version as indicated below. This minimum required driver can be different from the driver packaged with the CUDA Toolkit but should belong to the same major release.

    CUDA 11.0 was released with an earlier driver version, but by upgrading to Tesla Recommended Drivers 450.80.02 (Linux) / 452.39 (Windows) as indicated, minor version compatibility is possible across the CUDA 11.x family of toolkits.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  While applications built against any of the older CUDA Toolkits always continued to function on newer drivers due to binary backward compatibility, before CUDA 11, applications built against newer CUDA Toolkit releases were not supported on older drivers without forward compatibility package.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are using a new CUDA 10.x minor release, then the minimum required driver version is the same as the driver thatâs packaged as part of that toolkit release. Consequently, the minimum required driver version changed for every new CUDA Toolkit minor release until CUDA 11.1. Therefore, system administrators always have to upgrade drivers in order to support applications built against CUDA Toolkits from 10.x releases.

  With minor version compatibility, upgrading to CUDA 11.1 is now possible on older drivers from within the same major release family such as 450.80.02 that was shipped with CUDA 11.0, as shown below:
 </p>
 <p>
  Minimum required driver version guidance can be found in the CUDA Toolkit Release Notes. Note that if the minimum required driver version is not installed in the system, applications will return an error as shown below.

  Application Considerations for Minor Version Compatibility

 <p>
  Developers and system admins should note two important caveats when relying on minor version compatibility. If either of these caveats are limiting, then a new CUDA driver from the same minor version of the toolkit that the application was built with or later is required.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Limited feature set
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometimes features introduced in a CUDA Toolkit version may actually span both the toolkit and the driver. In such cases an application that relies on features introduced in a newer version of the toolkit and driver may return the following error on older drivers: cudaErrorCallRequiresNewerDriver. As mentioned earlier, admins should then upgrade the installed driver also.
   </p>
   <p>
    Application developers can avoid running into this problem by having the application explicitly check for the availability of features. Refer to the CUDA Compatibility Developers Guide for more details.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Applications using PTX will see runtime issues
   </p>
   <p>
    Applications that compile device code to PTX will not work on older drivers. If the application requires PTX then admins have to upgrade the installed driver.
   </p>
   <p>
    PTX Developers should refer to the CUDA Compatibility Developers Guide and PTX programming guide in the
    <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#binary-compatibility">
     CUDA C++ Programming Guide

 <p>
  As described, applications that directly rely only on the CUDA runtime can be deployed in the following two scenarios:
 </p>
 <p>
  CUDA driver thatâs installed on the system is newer than the runtime.
CUDA runtime is newer than the CUDA driver on the system but they are from the same major release of CUDA Toolkit.
 </p>
 <p>
  In scenario 2, system admins should be aware of the aforementioned limitations and should be able to tell why an application may be failing if they run into any issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  Minor version compatibility has another benefit that offers flexibility in the use and deployment of libraries. Applications that use libraries that support minor version compatibility can be deployed on systems with a different version of the toolkit and libraries without recompiling the application for the difference in the library version. This holds true for both older and newer versions of the libraries provided they are all from the same major release family. Note that libraries themselves have interdependencies that should be considered. For example, each cuDNN version requires a certain version of cuBLAS.

 <p>
  However, if an application is unable to leverage the minor version compatibility due to any of the aforementioned reasons, then the Forward Compatibility model can be used as an alternative even though Forward Compatibility is mainly intended for compatibility across major toolkit versions.

 <p>
  Increasingly, data centers and enterprises may not want to update the NVIDIA GPU Driver across major release versions due to the rigorous testing and validation that happens before any system level driver installations are done.
 </p>
 <p>
  To support such scenarios, CUDA introduced a Forward Compatibility Upgrade path in CUDA 10.0.

 <p>
  Forward Compatibility is applicable only for systems with NVIDIA Data Center GPUs or select NGC Server Ready SKUs of RTX cards. Itâs mainly intended to support applications built on newer CUDA Toolkits to run on systems installed with an older NVIDIA Linux GPU driver from different major release families. This new forward-compatible upgrade path requires the use of a special package called âCUDA compat packageâ.

  The CUDA compat package is available in the local installers or the CUDA network repositories provided by NVIDIA as cuda-compat-12.4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Install the package on the system using the package installer.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Ubuntu, for example:
 </p>
 <p>
  The compat package will then be installed to the versioned toolkit location typically found in the toolkit directory. For example, for 12.5 it will be found in
  <span class="pre">
   /usr/local/cuda-12.5/
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The cuda-compat package consists of the following files:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    <span class="pre">
     libcuda.so.*
    </span>

  Use the Right Compat Package

 <p>
  CUDA forward compat packages should be used only in the following situations when forward compatibility is required across major releases.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CUDA compat package is named after the highest toolkit that it can support. If you are on the R470 driver but require 12.5 application support, please install the cuda-compat package for 12.5. But when performing a full system upgrade, when choosing to install both the toolkit and the driver, remove any forward compatible packages present in the system.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if you are upgrading the driver to 525.60.13 which is the minimum required driver version for the 12.x toolkits, then the cuda-compat package is not required in most cases. 11.x and 12.x applications will be supported due to backward compatibility and future 12.x applications will be supported due to minor-version compatibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  But there are feature restrictions that may make this option less desirable for your scenario - for example: Applications requiring PTX JIT compilation support. Unlike the minor-version compatibility that is defined between CUDA runtime and CUDA driver, forward compatibility is defined between the kernel driver and the CUDA driver, and hence such restrictions do not apply. In order to circumvent the limitation, a forward compatibility package may be used in such scenarios as well.

  Deployment Model for Forward Compatibility

   ï
  </a>
 </h2>
 <p>
  There are two models of deployment for the CUDA compat package. We recommend the use of the âsharedâ deployment mode.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Shared deployment: Allows sharing the same compat package across installed toolkits in the system. Download and extract the latest forward compatibility package with the highest toolkit version in its name. Using RPATH, or through
    <span class="pre">
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    </span>
    or through an automatic loader (for example,
    <span class="pre">
     ld.so.conf
    </span>
    ), point to that package. This is the most recommended choice.
   </p>
   <p>
    The user can set
    <span class="pre">
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    </span>
    to include the files installed before running the CUDA 11.1 application:
   </p>
   <pre><span class="n">$</span><span class="n">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">local</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cuda</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">compat</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Per-application deployment: Individual applications can choose a package of their choice and place it as part of the Modules system tied to the toolkit and the libraries. Using the Modules system, the admin, or the user, can set up âmoduleâ scripts for each version of each toolkit package, and then load the module script for the toolkit as needed.
   </p>
   <pre><span class="n">$</span><span class="k">module</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="n">cuda</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mf">11.0</span>
</pre>
   <p>
    There is an important consideration to the per-application deployment approach: older forward compatibility packages are not supported on new driver versions. Therefore the module load scripts should proactively query the system for whether the compatibility package can be used before loading the files. This is especially critical if there was a full system upgrade. In the cases where the module script cannot use CUDA compatible upgrade, a fallback path to the default systemâs installed CUDA driver can provide a more consistent experience and this can be achieved using
    <span class="pre">
     RPATH

 <p>
  The CUDA driver maintains backward compatibility to continue support of applications built on older toolkits. Using a compatible minor driver version, applications build on CUDA Toolkit 11 and newer are supported on any driver from within the corresponding major release. Using the CUDA Forward Compatibility package, system administrators can run applications built using a newer toolkit even when an older driver that does not satisfy the minimum required driver version is installed on the system. This forward compatibility allows the CUDA deployments in data centers and enterprises to benefit from the faster release cadence and the latest features and performance of CUDA Toolkit.
 </p>
 <p>
  CUDA compatibility helps users by:
 </p>
 <ul class="simple">
  <li>
   <p>
    Faster upgrades to the latest CUDA releases: Enterprises or data centers with NVIDIA GPUs have complex workflows and require advance planning for NVIDIA driver rollouts. Not having to update the driver for newer CUDA releases can mean that new versions of the software can be made available faster to users without any delays.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Faster upgrades of the CUDA libraries: Users can upgrade to the latest software libraries and applications built on top of CUDA (for example, math libraries or deep learning frameworks) without an upgrade to the entire CUDA Toolkit or driver. This is possible as these libraries and frameworks do not have a direct dependency on the CUDA runtime, compiler or driver.

    Does CUDA forward compatible upgrades work intra-branch?
   </p>
   <p>
    Users can upgrade the kernel mode driver within the same branch. Sometimes this may require updating the
    <span class="pre">
     cuda-compat*
    </span>
    package. This use-case is supported only for drivers on LLB and LTS branches of driver for select GPUs.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Which GPUs are supported by the driver?
   </p>
   <p>
    The CUDA compatible upgrade is meant to ease the management of large production systems for enterprise customers. 11.4 UMD (User Mode Driver) and later will extend forward compatibility support to select NGC Ready NVIDIA RTX boards. Prior to that forward compatibility will be supported only on NVIDIA Data Center cards.
Itâs important to note that HW support is defined by the kernel mode driver and as such, newer CUDA drivers on their own will not enable new HW support. Refer to the following table to determine which hardware is supported by your system.

    The developer is using PTX code in the application and seeing some errors or issues. What should we do?
   </p>
   <p>
    PTX and application compatibility information can be found in
    <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#binary-compatibility">

   <p>
    If we build our CUDA application using CUDA 11.0, can it continue to be used with newer NVIDIA drivers (such as CUDA 11.1/R455, 11.x etc.)? Or is it only the other way around?
   </p>
   <p>
    Drivers have always been backwards compatible with CUDA. This means that a CUDA 11.0 application will be compatible with R450 (11.0), R455 (11.1) and beyond. CUDA applications typically statically include all the libraries (for example cudart, CUDA math libraries such as cuBLAS, cuFFT) they need, so they should work on new drivers or CUDA Toolkit installations.
   </p>
   <p>
    In other words, since CUDA is backward compatible, existing CUDA applications can continue to be used with newer CUDA versions.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What is the minimum CUDA 11.x driver that supports the CUDA minor version compatibility?
   </p>
   <p>
    The minimum driver version required is 450.80.02.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What about new features introduced in minor releases of CUDA? How does a developer build an application using newer CUDA Toolkits (e.g. 11.x) work on a system with a CUDA 11.0 driver (R450)?
   </p>
   <p>
    By using new CUDA versions, users can benefit from new CUDA programming model APIs, compiler optimizations and math library features.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      A subset of CUDA APIs donât need a new driver and they can all be used without any driver dependencies. For example, async copy APIs introduced in 11.1 do not need a new driver.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      To use other CUDA APIs introduced in a minor release (that require a new driver), one would have to implement fallbacks or fail gracefully. This situation is not different from what is available today where developers use macros to compile out features based on CUDA versions. Users should refer to the CUDA headers and documentation for new CUDA APIs introduced in a release.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some issues that admins can advise the application developers to accommodate in their code. Please refer to the Best Practices Guide for further information.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Does CUDA compatibility work with containers?
   </p>
   <p>
    Yes. CUDA minor version compatibility and CUDA forward compatible upgrade both work when using either NGC Deep Learning Framework containers or using containers that are based on the official CUDA base images. The images include the CUDA compatible upgrade libraries and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker2) has logic to correctly load the required libraries.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Iâm running an NGC container and see this error: âThis container was built for NVIDIA Driver Release 450.51 or later, but version 418.126.02 was detected and compatibility mode is UNAVAILABLE.â. What could be wrong?
   </p>
   <p>
    It is possible you are either running a wrong version of the NVIDIA driver on the system or your system does not have an NVIDIA Data Center GPU.
