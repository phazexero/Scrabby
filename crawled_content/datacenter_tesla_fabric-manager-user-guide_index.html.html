  NVIDIA products are not designed, authorized, or warranted to be
                                 suitable for use in medical, military, aircraft, space, or
                                 life support equipment, nor in applications where failure or
                                 malfunction of the NVIDIA product can reasonably be expected
                                 to result in personal injury, death, or property or
                                 environmental damage. NVIDIA accepts no liability for
                                 inclusion and/or use of NVIDIA products in such equipment or
                                 applications and therefore such inclusion and/or use is at
                                 customerâs own risk.

  NVIDIA makes no representation or warranty that products based on
                                 this document will be suitable for any specified use.
                                 Testing of all parameters of each product is not necessarily
                                 performed by NVIDIA. It is customerâs sole responsibility to
                                 evaluate and determine the applicability of any information
                                 contained in this document, ensure the product is suitable
                                 and fit for the application planned by customer, and perform
                                 the necessary testing for the application in order to avoid
                                 a default of the application or the product. Weaknesses in
                                 customerâs product designs may affect the quality and
                                 reliability of the NVIDIA product and may result in
                                 additional or different conditions and/or requirements
                                 beyond those contained in this document. NVIDIA accepts no
                                 liability related to any default, damage, costs, or problem
                                 which may be based on or attributable to: (i) the use of the
                                 NVIDIA product in any manner that is contrary to this
                                 document or (ii) customer product designs.
